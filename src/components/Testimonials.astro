          Samaya is a wonderful practitioner. I have been receiving treatments
          from her for years, and I always am so thankful to have her in my
          life! Her treatments provide effective relief for my aches and pains,
          and support me through emotional ups and downs. She is a gifted
          herbalist and always knows just the right thing to help me. She is
          consistently thorough in both understanding what I am hoping for with
          the treatment and in answering any questions I may have. Her style of
          acupuncture is very gentle and restorative—I am so appreciative of her
          care and recommend her to everyone!

          I cannot sing Samaya's praises ENOUGH. She is a gifted healer,
          herbalist, acupuncturist, and all-around amazing human. She continues
          to successfully usher me through perimenopause with wisdom, insight,
          ease, grace, and loving kindness. I recommend her so highly. 10 stars
          for Samaya!

          Samaya is truly phenomenal at what she does. She has been my
          acupuncturist throughout the years, before I had kids, on my fertility
          journey, through two pregnancies, two healing journeys, and while
          raising my family. She is gentle and my kids love her. She has helped
          me troubleshoot so many challenging matters regarding our health, and
          she just always makes me feel better. She gives us magical teas and
          drops to drink and makes me laugh. She’s a gift!

          enough! She has been an absolute game changer in helping me manage a

          and I never feel rushed during my appointments. Her bedside manner is
          unmatched—she is compassionate, knowledgeable, and deeply intuitive in
          her practice. Every time I leave a session, I feel balanced,
          rejuvenated, and grateful for her care.

          equally positive experience. If you are looking for an acupuncturist
